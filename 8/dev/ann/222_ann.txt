Abortion Foe Charged in Slaying



BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) --

Dr. Barnett Slepian, just back from synagogue, was heating soup in his kitchen <TIMEX>last fall</TIMEX> when he was gunned down with a single shot through a window.

Slepian's killer is still at large. But for the first time, authorities have named a suspect in the slaying -- anti-abortion activist James Kopp.

``<TIMEX>Today</TIMEX>, I'm here to tell you we have our suspect,'' said Bernard Tolbert, special agent-in-charge of the FBI's Buffalo office.

Kopp, 44, of St. Albans, Vt., became the subject of an international manhunt in <TIMEX>November</TIMEX> when he was called a witness in the case. He was charged <TIMEX>Thursday</TIMEX> in state and federal complaints with second-degree murder and with violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act by using deadly force against an abortion doctor.

Both charges carry a penalty of up to life in prison. The federal charge also carries a fine of up to $250,000.

Kopp's whereabouts remain unknown. He was last seen <TIMEX>Nov. 3</TIMEX>, the day before authorities issued a material witness warrant in the Slepian shooting in the hope of questioning him. Until <TIMEX>Thursday</TIMEX>, they had not called Kopp a suspect.

Investigators would not divulge the evidence against Kopp but said <TIMEX>last month</TIMEX>'s discovery of a scope-equipped rifle buried near the Slepian home represented a major breakthrough. Slepian, 52, was shot with a rifle.

Kopp also has been linked, through DNA testing, to a strand of hair found near where the sniper fired, law enforcement sources have said.

Nicknamed the ``Atomic Dog'' in anti-abortion circles, Kopp had been arrested in several states since <TIMEX>1990</TIMEX> for protesting abortion. His car was spotted in Slepian's neighborhood in the <TIMEX>weeks</TIMEX> before the shooting, and was found abandoned at the Newark, N.J., airport in <TIMEX>December</TIMEX>.

The filing of the charges has intensified interest in Kopp as a suspect in three non-fatal sniper attacks on Canadian abortion providers, and one near Rochester, N.Y., between <TIMEX>1994</TIMEX> and <TIMEX>1997</TIMEX>.

Kopp is now the second anti-abortion activist being sought by the FBI as a suspect in a fatal attack.

Eric Rudolph has been on the run since the <TIMEX>January 1998</TIMEX> bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and maimed a nurse. He also is charged in three Atlanta attacks, including the <TIMEX>1996</TIMEX> Olympic bombing that killed one person.
