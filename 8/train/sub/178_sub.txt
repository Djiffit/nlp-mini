Savin Corp. reported a <TIMEX>third-quarter</TIMEX> net loss of $35.2 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with year-<TIMEX>earlier</TIMEX> profit of $3.8 million, or one cent a share.

A spokesman for the Stamford, Conn.based company said operations had a loss of $5.5 million for <TIMEX>the quarter</TIMEX>; in addition, the loss was magnified by nonrecurring charges totaling $23.5 million and $8.2 million in asset-valuation adjustments that he described as "unusual." The charges were partly offset by a $2 million gain on the sale of investments of two joint ventures, he said.

Revenue declined 8% to $85.7 million, from $93.3 million <TIMEX>a year earlier</TIMEX>. Savin cited "a general softening in the demand for office products in the market segments in which Savin competes."
