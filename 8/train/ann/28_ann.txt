Libya, which brought the case to the United Nations' highest judicial body in its dispute with the United States and Britain, hailed the ruling and said it would press anew for a trial in a third neutral country. Both U.S. and British officials filed objections to the court's jurisdiction in <TIMEX>1995</TIMEX>, claiming Security Council resolutions imposed on Lybia to force the suspects' extradition overruled a <TIMEX>1971</TIMEX> Convention which gives Libya the right to try the men. The decision, 3rd graf pvs.
